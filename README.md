Explanation: servers are listeners to client request and would perform actions based on the clients request but first, the client 
must obey the rules of a database.

The database creates a schema found on the ---MODEL FILE--- this is where the database lays down certain rules that the client must conform to in other to save his data.
the ---ROUTERS FOLDER--- is a folder that checks for the kind of request made on the server.

CHECK THE MONGOOSEjs DOCUMENTATION TO CHECK HOW TO SET UP THE DATABASE. ALWAYS READ A MODULES TO UNDERSTAND THE UNDERLYING PROPERTIES AND METHODS USED BY THE MODULE.
